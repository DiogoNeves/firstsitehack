Hey :)  
Finished the main behaviour for the client but I'll have to show you tomorrow, was too tired to move it to the live server :S sorry.  
  
One thing I noticed is missing (completely forgot about it hehe), we'll need to be able to set how much score is each image worth (probably another field in the image edit page?)  
What do you think?  
  
There's still stuff to do hehe but is mostly flow (got back, next and tag working though) and preview + crop display  
  
I'll see you soon ;) my changes are in a different branch so it doesn't add a DB dependency to what you're doing ;)  
  
Cheers
